# Visitor Form Test Checklist

## Summary of Changes Made

### 1. **Consolidated Form Initialization Logic**
- Removed multiple conflicting `useEffect` hooks that were overwriting form values
- Created a single, comprehensive `useEffect` for setting form values when editing
- This ensures form values are set only once when all required data is loaded

### 2. **Improved Field Preservation During Mode Switching**
- Modified the cross-chapter checkbox handler to only reset fields when creating new visitors
- When editing, the checkbox no longer clears existing field values unnecessarily
- This preserves field values when toggling between visitor types during editing

### 3. **Optimized Update Submission**
- For cross-chapter visitors: Only sends the 4 required fields (meetingId, isCrossChapter, chapterId, invitedById)
- For regular visitors: Implements field change detection to only send modified fields
- This prevents unnecessary null values from being sent to the backend

### 4. **Fixed Field Reset Issues**
- Removed automatic setting of invitedById when switching chapters
- Let users explicitly select invited by member instead of auto-filling
- This prevents unwanted field changes during form interaction

## Testing Instructions

### Test Case 1: Creating a Cross-Chapter Visitor
1. Navigate to Add Visitor form
2. Check "Cross Chapter Visitor" checkbox
3. Verify only two fields appear: "From Chapter" and "Invited By"
4. Select a chapter and member
5. Submit and verify creation

### Test Case 2: Creating a Regular Visitor
1. Navigate to Add Visitor form
2. Leave "Cross Chapter Visitor" unchecked
3. Fill all required fields (name, gender, mobile1, chapter, category, address, etc.)
4. Submit and verify creation

### Test Case 3: Editing a Cross-Chapter Visitor
1. Edit an existing cross-chapter visitor
2. Verify the form loads with:
   - "Cross Chapter Visitor" checkbox checked
   - Correct chapter selected
   - Correct invited by member selected
   - No regular visitor fields shown
3. Change the chapter or invited by member
4. Submit and verify only changed fields are updated

### Test Case 4: Editing a Regular Visitor
1. Edit an existing regular visitor
2. Verify all fields are populated correctly
3. Change only 2-3 fields (e.g., mobile number and city)
4. Submit and verify only changed fields are sent in the update request

### Test Case 5: Switching Visitor Type During Edit
1. Edit a cross-chapter visitor
2. Uncheck "Cross Chapter Visitor"
3. Verify form shows all regular fields (should be empty)
4. Fill the required fields
5. Submit and verify the visitor is converted to regular type

### Test Case 6: Field Validation
1. For cross-chapter: Try submitting without selecting chapter or member
2. For regular: Try submitting without required fields
3. Verify appropriate validation messages appear

## Expected Behavior

1. **When editing**: Form should preserve all existing values and only send changed fields on update
2. **Cross-chapter visitors**: Should only require and save chapter ID and invited by member
3. **Regular visitors**: Should require all mandatory fields and preserve optional field values
4. **Mode switching**: Should work smoothly without losing data unnecessarily

## Debug Console Logs

The following debug logs have been added to help verify functionality:
- `[DEBUG] Setting form values for editing:` - Shows initial form setup
- `[DEBUG] Submitting cross-chapter visitor:` - Shows data being sent for cross-chapter
- `[DEBUG] Submitting regular visitor:` - Shows data being sent for regular visitors
- `[DEBUG] Updating with changed fields:` - Shows only changed fields during update

## Known Issues Fixed

1. ✅ Multiple useEffect hooks causing form values to be overwritten
2. ✅ Fields being cleared unnecessarily when switching between modes
3. ✅ All fields being sent on update instead of just changed ones
4. ✅ invitedById being auto-set when it shouldn't be
5. ✅ Form not properly distinguishing between cross-chapter and regular visitors during edit
